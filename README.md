# Movie-Queue

MovieQueue is a Python-based app designed to help you organize and explore movies you plan to watch in the future. With an easy-to-use graphical interface, the app allows you to add movies, view details such as descriptions and streaming platform availability, filter movies by genre, and keep your watchlist updated effortlessly.

# Features
* Add movies to queue with their title and choose their genre <br>
* Filter by genre and access detailed information about a movie, including its description and poster <br>
* Remove movies from your queue once you've watched them or no longer plan to watch <br>
* Automatically fetch streaming platform availability in your country using the TMDb API <br> <br>

 # How To use
  1.  Set up the Database: Ensure that a MySQL database named movies_db is set up with a table for storing movie data. <br>
  2.  Obtain a TMDb API Key: Create an account on The Movie Database (TMDb) and generate an API key. You'll need this key to fetch movie data and streaming platform details. <br>
  3.  Update the Code: Replace placeholders (your_api_key, your_country_code, your_password) in the code with your TMDb API key, country code, and MySQL password. <br>
  4.  Run the App: Execute the Python script to launch the graphical interface. <br>
  5.  Start your movie queue!! Click the "Add a Movie" button, enter the movie title and genre, and the app will fetch the streaming platforms automatically. Click "View Movies" to see your entire movie queue, including title, genre, and available platforms. <br>
